# ATLAS-Task

### Objective
Task is to compress the given data using Autoencoders. Tabular data is provided with 4 variables which has to be compressed to 3 variables using Autoencoder. 

### Quick Guide
__Data__: Data is available in the data directory. <br>
__Notebooks__: There are two jupyter notebooks available. They are well commented and I have tried to explain the code as much as possible. 
One notebook uses given pre-trained model and finetunes it. In other notebook I have tried various models and train from scratch to compress the data so that it gives me better understanding how the network could be improved.  

There is one python file as well which contains the code for network class and other necessary functions. 

__NOTE__: The code written in the notebooks is built over https://github.com/Skelpdar/HEPAutoencoders  work as one objective of task was also to understand this code and work.
